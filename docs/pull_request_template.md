Thanks for your contribution! This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) as a guide for commit messages. Please ensure that your commit message follows this structure:

```
type(component?): message
```

*type* is one of: feat, fix, docs, chore, style, refactor, perf, test

*component* optionally is the name of the module you are fixing; either "core" or a named module in `plugins/` directory. Note: Please specify the full name of the module (e.g. plugin-bash-like) instead of abbreviation. It helps us generate the correct CHANGELOG.md.

Thanks!
