# Kui Custom Clients

This directory is intended for development of custom clients via a
fork of the main Kui repository. The [default](./default) directory
houses the custom client that Kui uses for its continuous integration
and delivery pipeline.

Please consult the [custom client
documentation](../docs/dev/custom-clients.md) for more information on
developing a Kui client, including your development options, the
customization opportunities, how to extend Kui by adding custom
plugins, and how to build headless, electron, and webpack
distributions.
